# APE Project Logos README

## Introduction

This folder contains the official logos used for APE-related projects. These logos are provided to ensure consistent branding and representation across various mediums and platforms. Please adhere to the guidelines provided in this document when using these logos.

## How to Use the Logos

- **Choosing the Right Logo:** Ensure you select the appropriate logo variant for your specific application, considering the background, size, and context in which the logo will be displayed.
- **Resizing:** Logos should be resized proportionally, maintaining the aspect ratio to prevent distortion.

## Guidelines for Usage

- **Do Not Modify:** Avoid modifying the logos beyond resizing. This includes altering the design, adding effects, or changing colors.
- **Clear Space:** Maintain a clear space around the logo. This space should be free of text, graphics, or other elements that could detract from the logo's visibility and impact.
